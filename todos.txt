- add test for bind

- make sure good (performant) way is chosen to tackle seat reservation. E.g. make sure
there isn't a tabe locking in table. Perform test (in which another api wants to read
the price of a seat ticket meanwhile someone is trying to acquire the same seat and use
artificial delay and make sure request completes soon). Perform load testing.
